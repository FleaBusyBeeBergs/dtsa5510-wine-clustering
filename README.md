## Introduction

For this project, I will be working with the Wine dataset from the University of California, Irvine. I will be using a few different clustering methods on the dataset and tuning some hyperparameters to optimize classification accuracy.

I chose this dataset because I personally enjoy drinking wine and pairing it with food. While this is a simple clustering project, a lot can be done with machine learning for food and drink recommender systems. A quick internet search brings up several different projects, both small and large. As this is my first course in unsupervised learning, I'll start with something basic.
